# Simple Proxy – COMP30023 Project

A simple HTTP proxy server built as part of **COMP30023: Computer Systems** at the **University of Melbourne** in **2025**.  
Created by **F. Madyarov** and **J. Lewis**.

## 🧠 About

This project implements a basic proxy server capable of handling HTTP requests and forwarding them to their intended destinations. The server parses requests, caches responses, and demonstrates a practical understanding of networking, sockets, and system-level programming in C. The proxy implements simple and valid caching with a cache size of 10, and also handles stale cache entries if requested.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Handles multiple client connections using `select()`
- Parses and forwards HTTP GET requests
- Simple in-memory caching for performance improvement
- Handles basic error cases (e.g., unsupported methods, bad requests)
- Command-line interface to run the proxy on a specific port

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C (POSIX sockets)
- Standard C libraries (`stdio`, `stdlib`, `string`, etc.)
- Linux/MacOS development environment

---
